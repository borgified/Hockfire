Notes:
You might need to install python; and you may have to change 'ppython' to 'python' 
This file (Test.bat) doesn't need to be placed in any specific folder.
This may actually not work in earlier stages as file paths may be specific to one developer and not
dinamic (adaptable to any sistem). Don't forget to fix this!
