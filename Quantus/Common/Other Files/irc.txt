--> You are now talking on #Quantus
<fuh-zz> third, your players
<fuh-zz> oh good timing scratch let me start over
<-- TheSambasti-AFK has quit (Ping timeout)
<fuh-zz> samb was just telling me about predictibility
 <fuh-zz> hmm
 <fuh-zz> well first let's talk about what makes Allegiance predictable
 1)  The more static your environment is, the more predictable things are
<scratch> yup
<fuh-zz> 2)  The more you know your available technology and the enemies technology, the more predictable
 and lastly 3)  your players
 your idea changes #2
 but i think we can go a bit further, and this applies to #1 as well
 what if we could come up with unique randomness to each of those elements?
 for example, perhaps your supply chain has been cut off over the planet!
 allegiance does have a few random elements
 it has random spawning technology (to a point) and also random aleph placement and asteroids
 But, what I'm basically saying is, the more random the game is, the less predictable it is.
<scratch> most of our map generation can be done by the computer, so you could have literally random maps, even sectors etc.
<fuh-zz> yes that is a great approach i believe we were already thinking about
 i don't know if you were in the conversation or not, but I was talking with someone about getting rid of sectors/alephs and replacing them with random chokepoints
 because when you think about it, we're not in space anymore

<TheSambasti-AFK> k
 sorry
 was gone for a sec
 alleg
<fuh-zz> grrrrrr
<TheSambasti-AFK> why is it predictable
 well
 :/
<fuh-zz> let me pastebint he convo
 lol
<TheSambasti-AFK> noooooooo!!!
 I missed something!!!!
--- TheSambasti-AFK is now known as TheSambasti
<scratch> heh
<fuh-zz> http://alleg.pastebin.com/K5aMWcNC
<scratch> fuzz, i always rather liked sectors
 and a big advantage is we dont have to render beyond them
<TheSambasti> :P
<fuh-zz> well we can still keep sectors, but do alephs really make sense?
<TheSambasti> we are not in space anymore!
<scratch> which means bigger maps
<TheSambasti> k
 about randomization
 we need to be careful
 about making things to random
 because if we go to far
<scratch> hmm, i think samb just pointed out our new tag line
<TheSambasti> you cant even make strats anymore
 so random map with random chokes at the start = yes
<fuh-zz> yes i alread had it scratch :P
<scratch> well done fuzz, samb, im putting that on the website
<TheSambasti> but total random crap
 in the middle of the game
 that makes previous stuff
 you set up at the start of the match = no
 thats just being mean :P
<fuh-zz> well samb you still have all sorts of random elements
<TheSambasti> Im pretty sure fuzz had that tagline
 as the topic of our chat
 a while back
 what i mean is
 stuff
<fuh-zz> for example do you have a forest next to the enemy base or a cliff?
<TheSambasti> that effects the setting of the game
 like what you just said
 is good
 however
 having a volcano
 randomly spawn in the middle of the match
 ruining your carefully set mining operation
 is bad
 also
<fuh-zz> no i'm not talking about random events
<TheSambasti> the varying terrain
 would mean
 that you have to plan your bse
 *base
 decide where to move it
 ect
 or at least
 <fuh-zz> you WANT varying terrain, right?
<TheSambasti> `1`1`1`1
<fuh-zz> alright, so we already had a few ideas about this in the first place
 to clarify my point of view
 i also want to avoid random things that can completely fuck you over
<TheSambasti> good
 fucking people over takes out the fun
<fuh-zz> i know
<TheSambasti> anyway
 on players
 the #3 thing
<fuh-zz> there's a thin line, and the line is between "Awww I got fucked" and "THIS GAME SUCKS"
<TheSambasti> random newbies change the game
<fuh-zz> yep i agree
<TheSambasti> lots of other stuff players do
 right now
<fuh-zz> there's not much we can do about #3 though
<TheSambasti> what makes alleg annoying
 is that people are clueless
 we need better tuts
 and we need a system
 where people understand
 that people cant just go in
 shoot at stuff
 and go lolzor I hit a guy
 I dont care my base died
 how exactly we can do this
 is open
 to question
 cdt
 is good
 but it doesn't catch enough people
 I would consider integrating
 something like TS into the game
 but I am not sure how feasable that is
<scratch> that is huge tho
 possible maybe
 i dont know
 brb
<TheSambasti> Basically]
 I want to drag the standard game
 more into the direction of alleg sg
 or a squad stack
 I personally think
 alleg squad stacks
 are so awesome
 not because everyone knows everyone else
 but because people automatically adopt
 more of a team mentality
 and rely on each other
 communicate more
 its a culture thing
 brb
 afk for 5
 thoughts?
<fuh-zz> well samb, that's not my department :P
<scratch> thinking isnt your department? :p
<fuh-zz> lol
 ok you win
 the problem with people is
 there are many out there who don't have the motive for teamplay
--- fuh-zz gives channel operator status to TheSambasti
 fuh-zz gives channel operator status to scratch
 fuh-zz gives voice to grv_
<scratch> and we need to auto detect such people and ban them!
<fuh-zz> has grv_ ever talked in here?
<scratch> once,
 it was a tuesday
<fuh-zz> i wonder if he reads all this
 we could actually use a commander's point of view
<scratch> yeah
 an important issue when we work on this is:
 how important should the team vs commander be?
 this is something i brought up in the original discussion with samb
<-- TheSambasti has quit (Ping timeout)
<fuh-zz> team vs commander?
 i never realized they fought each other
--> TheSambasti (~sambasti@c-98-234-170-95.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #Quantus
<TheSambasti> <@fuh-zz> we could actually use a commander's point of view
 I command
 and people are retards
 pretty much sums it up
<fuh-zz> you may be a commander, but your not grav!
<scratch> fuzz: should a good comm be able to win the game with a team of noobs against an average comm?
<TheSambasti> `1
 actually
 noobs are more helpful than voobs
 any com will tell you that
 because noobs are like puddy
 you can shape them to do awesome things
<fuh-zz> it should be almost half/half scratch
<TheSambasti> you just need to instruct them
--- fuh-zz gives channel operator status to TheSambasti
 TheSambasti has changed the topic to: We're not in space anymore!
<TheSambasti> so yes
 it should be possible
 however
 it depends on how you define noob, good comm, and average comm
 I think
 the worst thing is
 that people dont listen to the comm
 esp if they are average
 another effect of the squad stack
<scratch> allright, should spidey be able to win with a pickup team vs a squad?
<TheSambasti> no
 he wont
 not in alle
 and he shouldn't in quantus
 like I said
 squad stack
 automatically doubles every players skill
 and the main thing
 that seperates a good com from a bad one (motivating team)
 is no longer a problem
<scratch> mm, well said
<TheSambasti> the big thing is
 culture
 the players
 need to be motivated
 to play as a team
 that
 will automatically
 make you win any PUG in alleg
 some of my fondest memories
 are of teams
 that would get it done
 without me having to micro everything
 and it wasn't because they could dogfight
 or sb
 or were somehow incredibly skilled
 it was just that when I said d high
 they defended high
 and when I said galv
<fuh-zz> alright samb well
<TheSambasti> they would get together
 except for the one guy who new he should probe
<fuh-zz> how do we do that?
* TheSambasti sighs
<TheSambasti> thats the problem
 I dont know how
 <@TheSambasti> the big thing is
 <@TheSambasti> culture
 first off
 forum account
 should be tied to game account
<scratch> a task menu could improve things a little, but not that much,
<TheSambasti> no players that arent on forums
 then
 better tutorials
<scratch> yes, agree with forum/game
 link
<TheSambasti> stressing that without teamwork
 you will fail
<fuh-zz> like i said to scratch before
<fuh-zz> some people just don't give a shit about their team
<TheSambasti> exactly
 somehow
 we weed those out
<fuh-zz> and those are the kind of people who can't be convinced
<TheSambasti> not necessairly banning
 but giving them a reason
 to give a shit aobut their team
 like cash penalty
 or a label like team hater
<fuh-zz> a lot of that is the COMMANDER's decision
 there are just some people we don't want around here, we can't be too noob friendly
 unlike what popular carebears will say
<TheSambasti> I am personally all carebear
 but I think
 there is a differrence
 between the guy
 who messed up naning the miner
 and the guy
 who was chasing the scout 5 sectors away
 IMO we boot the wrong people around here
<scratch> between harold3(0) and newguy(0)
<fuh-zz> it's the comm's decision, doesn't bother me
<TheSambasti> except
 anti newbie culture
 kills games
 man this is difficult...
<fuh-zz> i don't believe there's an anti newb culture
 this is like
 the difference between do you spank your children or not?
<scratch> i think there would be without the serious rules and heavy ban hammer we get in alleg
<TheSambasti> lol
<scratch> and some argue we have it anyway (though ive never seen it)
<fuh-zz> personally i don't think we should worry about it unless it's something we implement into gameplay
 not yet anyway
<TheSambasti> well
 this goes along the line
 of how do we make people
 play as a team
<fuh-zz> commander boots people who don't participate in the team
 we can even recommend it to comms
 warn players
<TheSambasti> here is the thing I have seen in alleg
 and that makes this difficult
<fuh-zz> that way it depends on both the player AND the comm
<TheSambasti> what exactly is boot worthy
 if 1 person
 defends the miner
<scratch> an effective solution might be to give the comm more easily accessible intel on what people are doing
<TheSambasti> that we knew was going to be attacked
 who gets booted
 the prober in their home?
 those 2 guys chasing their con?
 were they doing something productive?
<fuh-zz> someone who was being useless....
<TheSambasti> what if no one was...
<fuh-zz> there's a difference between trying to be useful and not
 then i guess the commander boot resigns :P
<scratch> everyone defines useless differently,
<TheSambasti> bingo
<scratch> but maybe we can have less issue with that, if we get enough players for multiple games
<TheSambasti> that is our dilemma
 hopefully
 anyway
 this is pointless
<fuh-zz> like i keep saying, it's the commander's decision
<TheSambasti> until the game is out
<fuh-zz> <scratch> an effective solution might be to give the comm more easily accessible intel on what people are doing
<fuh-zz> that could help
<TheSambasti> right now
 the only thing
 we should be discussing
 is gameplay
 and how it will work out
 with teamwork
<fuh-zz> that's why i mentioned what scratch just said
<fuh-zz> anyway
 are any of us writing this down?
<scratch> im prolly going quiet for a bit, ill be around though, if you need me, say my name
<TheSambasti> I g2g
 see you all later
