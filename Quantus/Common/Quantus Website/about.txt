<h2>About Us</h2> 
The Quantus team is a dedicated group of players from a game called Allegiance, an online space RTS/FPS.  Until recently, we were based on the official Allegiance site, but we have created our own website in order to continue development.
The team working on Quantus has changed many times in the two years the project has been running.</p>  
<p>
The current team:
<h3>Full Time Devs</h3>
Finn Bryant - Dev Team Leader and Head Coder (codes and tells other people what to do)<br>
TheSambasti - Organizer; Gameplay Chief; Amateur Coder (organizes things [kinda like a CEO]; controls gameplay decisions; tries not to bug people while being incapable at working on the code)<br>
Fuzz - Code, Concept, and Spell checker (finds code errors, tells which ideas suck or dont work, and checks spelling in my posts)<br>
Hockfire - Modeler; GUI and Website designer (makes models for Quantus and works on graphics)<br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Part-Time/MIA/AWOL Devs</h3> 
Dare - Core System Creator; Modeler (Working on creating a system for the cores of Quantus; makes models for Quantus)<br>
Cookie Monster - Cookie eater; Concept and Story Line; Forum Mod (eats cookies while figuring out things about gameplay and writing the Story Line; Deletes all the stupid thing I write)<br>
