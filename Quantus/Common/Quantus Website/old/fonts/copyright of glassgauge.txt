<scratchee> oo, one thing i need to ask you before i forget, where did you get that glass font?
<TheSambasti> `4
<TheSambasti> need some help writing the texts?
<Hocfire> Let me see
<scratchee> "GlassGauge"
<scratchee> i managed to track down bn-3rd-place
<scratchee> and it was free, so no problem there
<Hocfire> ah, you mean the license
<scratchee> yeah
<Hocfire> sure, let me dug it up
<scratchee> @sambasti: yes! i suck at writing!
<scratchee> cool, thanks
<scratchee> lucida console wont matter too much, its generic enough and common enough that we can use a system font
<Hocfire> well, glassgauge comes in a .zip with no license at all
<Hocfire> let me see if i cand find something more
<scratchee> if you cant find anything (i couldnt) then im claiming its existance is an act of god and is therefore in the public domain
<Hocfire> downloaded it from 5-6 different sites, .zip file is always the same and with the font only as always
<scratchee> ok, its public domain, we did our best to check, that will do
<Hocfire> therefore, i think it's safe to use
<Hocfire> yeah.
<scratchee> yeah
<scratchee> :)
<TheSambasti> keep these logs on record
