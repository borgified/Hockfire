I always make some form of concept art first before modeling the models, and i will ocasionally dump it in here from time to time.

06/01/09:
 - Here's a nice drawing of the BIOS capships. I won't model them for now (and probably only when we need BIOS) so I guess I'l leave it here so it's in another place than in one of my notebooks.

28/01/09:
- Gigacorp lady concept art (just a small prototipe);
- IC basic hovering physics;
- IC Capships;

03/02/09:
 - A big building complex (may be map?) of a natural Quantus city. (It is pictured as it would be before being attacked by the Rasadan period, and it could just stay intact, as  a city that managed to escape relatively unharmed, or it could be applied some damage, mainly to the town center).
