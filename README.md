> ### Hello once again. I've left this community long ago, but I kept an entire array of contribution which, unfortunately, didn't make it to the general audience. I don't see a point in letting it die in my hard drive, so I've decided to release my works to the Allegiance community.

The files are compressed using 7zip, which is free.

My Allegiance folder is full (even though I lost some minor things) of my contribution to this wonderful community. 

Factions
========

[ALLEGIANCE.7ZIP.001](http://www.mediafire.com/?togtttobaa0l41l) AND [ALLEGIANCE.7ZIP.002](http://www.mediafire.com/?5hrc1b82we76vz0) *150 MB +129 MB, hosted on Mediafire (good speed but ads)*

Contents and Info

Bio-Lumen (Faction)
-------------------
* Formats are .wings (Wings3D), .ms3d (Milkshape), .mdl and .cvh (Allegiance), and some Paint.NET/Inkscape images. Milkshape is commercial.
* If you plan on making a new faction, looking at how I organized all the work on this one might be useful for you.
* Minimap images have an 'm' before 'BL', research icons have an 'i' and loadout icons have an 'l', in file names.
* Advanced bases have an 'a' (BLsup v BLasup). They share textures, so no performance impact with two models for each base.
* The Scar (concept):
    * 4 weapons - 3 "slaves" and one "main". The Scar can only take these weapons.
    * The "main" weapon is the one who does the (significant) damage, and requires a massive energy input. The Scar's own energy reserves are not enough. Therefore:
		* The "slaves" generate a small area damage, but act as energy-positive weapons. They "feed" energy to the ship (negative energy demand). You then need all 3 slaves and the main to be continuously firing the main.
        * The Scar has three arms pointing forward - the slaves fire from each tip, and the main fires between the three (from the actual point equidistant from the three arm tips).
		* All projectiles have 0 velocity, near zero lifetime and high ROF. What this means is, the particles of each weapon are literally fixed relative to the ship (and their origins).
		* Result is that you have a little sprite in the middle of the arms that kills anything it touches, eg. bases; but the Scar however needs to... "hug" them.

Faction X (Partial faction)
---------------------------
* Half the bases and half the ships of Faction X, including the Milkshape sources, textures and .mdl's, but mostly cvh's. Andon should have this and the other half. Andon owns the models and I own the cvh's.

Oil Gauge (HUD)
---------------
* Simple HUD I had done, quite streamlined and fairly hard to read but sleek and unclutters the view whilst keeping things at eye range.

Scores
------
* Old scores of my Allegiance games. This may be of not much interest to you; but hey, they were already in the folder, and perhaps you also star in them.

SPQR Avatars
------------
* Avatars of a now nonexistent squad. Includes sources for you to tinker with them.

Wallpapers
----------
* Of almost every faction. Includes normal and Widescreen.
* Sources and Paint.NET layers included.


Quantus
=======

I've tried to minimally organize the Quantus folder. Since everyone could access it, there should be no problem posting it up here. 

[QUANTUS.7ZIP](http://www.mediafire.com/?6tk5e0b3iyck96i) 54MB

Contents and Info
----------------- 
* My 400+ models, concepts, images and user interface, plus some more models. Wings 3D, Paint.NET, Inkscape were my (free) tools.
* Some coding and artwork from Fuzz, sambasti, devil and many others whose names are in the file. These belong to their respective owners.
* Numerous files of work flow and chatter.
* Clutter and/or dust particles.

> ### You, reader, are free to use my files for the good of this community (and eventual offspring of it), if you at least give me credit for my work. I'd specially like to see my faction finally be enjoyed in a core! If you plan to use my files for something else, please contact me. Everything else is bound to the will and right of their respective owners.

Thanks to all the individuals of this community who make this one of the friendliest (don't deny it) communities out there and thanks to those who plan on using these files for, again, the community.
